### Omar Ignacio Oyarce - Python Backend Developer & DevOps Engineer at AndesLab

Welcome to my GitHub profile. With over 2 years of experience developing sophisticated Python backend systems, I specialize in creating scalable solutions for automation, data analysis, and APIs. I currently work at AndesLab, a startup focused on automating and optimizing structural design through artificial intelligence.

#### Professional Overview
- **Global Perspective**: Chilean-born with an Italian passport, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative tech projects in Europe or the USA. My multicultural background drives me to engage with global tech communities and collaborate across borders.

- **Academic Excellence**: I recently completed my Master's thesis with the highest grade, applying advanced data analysis and simulation techniques. You can explore the repository for my thesis project here: [SQL-Python Data Project](https://github.com/ooyarce/SQL-Python-Data-Project-). The project involved extensive use of Python, SQL, and data manipulation to handle large-scale simulations and datasets.

#### Areas of Expertise
- **Backend Development & SaaS Solutions**: I have played a key role in developing core modules at AndesLab, ensuring seamless integration with APIs using Django, Flask, FastAPI, and agile methodologies such as Jira. Additionally, I have contributed to the development of a SaaS product, enhancing both backend functionality and user experience.

- **CI/CD & DevOps Automation**: I have implemented continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, Slack notifications, bots, and automated testing strategies. These systems help ensure a smooth deployment process and maintain high code quality.

- **QA Engineering & Software Testing**: I lead all quality assurance processes at AndesLab, including unit, functional, and integration tests, ensuring our software is reliable, scalable, and performs optimally in real-world applications.

- **Advanced Data Science & Libraries**: Proficient in leveraging advanced libraries like Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Selenium, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning. These tools have been crucial in automating complex simulations and enhancing the accuracy of predictive models.

#### Career Objective
I am focused on maximizing my skills as a Python Backend Developer and QA Engineer. I am actively looking for challenging roles in Europe or the USA, where I can apply my expertise in backend development, CI/CD, and automation to complex, impactful projects.
