I design and build production backend systems. At [**BuildaLab**](https://buildalab.io), I lead a small engineering team and architected the platform from the ground up.

**BuildaLab** is a prediction and optimization platform for construction projects. Real estate developers upload building models, and the system runs hundreds of structural simulations to predict costs, assess feasibility, and generate optimized design alternatives — all compliant with local building codes. It serves high-rise residential and commercial projects across Chile's construction industry.

Based in Chile · EU Citizen · Open to roles in **Europe** and the **US**.

## What I Work With

| Area | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | NestJS, Fastify, FastAPI, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 19, Zustand, TanStack Query, Tailwind, shadcn/ui |
| **Cloud** | AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, SES, Cognito, CloudWatch) |

## What I Do Well

- Architect and ship full backend systems — APIs, auth, queues, database design
- Build async processing pipelines that handle computation-heavy workloads reliably
- Own infrastructure end-to-end — from database schema to deployment pipeline
- Write tested, typed, documented code as a default, not an afterthought
- Lead a small team while staying deep in the codebase

## Other

- **Master's Thesis** — Highest honors · [Data Analysis with SQL & Python](https://github.com/ooyarce/SQL-Python-Data-Project-)
- **Languages** — Spanish (native) · English (C1) · Italian · German
